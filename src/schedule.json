			"description": "We’ve all heard these “laws” of design: “People don’t read on the web.” “If you have to explain how to use your product, you’ve failed.” “A picture is worth a thousand words.” It seems like our job as designers is to make things as intuitive as possible, using as few words as possible so that the meaning is self-evident through our visual design. But does this always produce the best user experience? Is showing always better than telling? We’ll look at several examples of design from the real world, the web, and apps that use showing, telling, or both as a method for producing the best UX. Rather than just assuming one is always better than the other, learn how to choose the right approach for your particular design problem and users.",

			"description": "Today's average website is 62% pure image data. We use images to convey emotion, elicit an action or simply to amuse our peers. They show holiday photos, pie charts or animated cats.\n\nTo the unitiated, nothing much has changed since the JPEG file format was standardized in 1992 and GIFs became capable of showing multiple frames of cat mischief. But under the hood, the complex realm of raster and vector images is ever changing: new encoders use cues from the fields of computer vision and machine learning to optimize image data, old formats learn new tricks and completely new image formats try to take the stage.\n\nTo deliver a great user experience, we need to learn to create high performance images and implement an image management strategy: leveraging the ideal image file formats and use advanced techniques to handle the challenges of responsive designs and situational performance. High performance images increase the perceived performance of your website, improve the user experience and drive conversions.",

Topics include: how to use event delegation for just in time initialization; how to structure your markup, CSS and JS for them to work well together while promoting maintainability of all three; how to avoid performance bottlenecks when using jQuery; how to use CSS3 transitions with fallbacks; and finally, how to reuse existing widgets with unique look and feel.",

When you have a team of pirates, it is possible to meet all the standards and still have time to enjoy the view.",
